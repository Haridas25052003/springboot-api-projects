Subject: README.md Content – Spring Boot Practice Repository

# Spring Boot Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my daily practice work in **Spring Boot**, where I build small backend applications to strengthen my understanding of RESTful APIs, database connectivity, and CRUD operations. The purpose of this repository is to improve my backend development skills by working on real-world use cases and continuously pushing my progress to GitHub.

## What This Repository Includes

* Spring Boot REST API projects
* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* MySQL / Database integration
* Controller, Service, and Repository layers
* Entity and DTO models
* API testing using Postman
* Error handling and validation

## Technologies Used

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Spring Data JPA / JDBC
* MySQL
* Hibernate
* RESTful APIs
* Maven
* Postman

## Folder Structure

Each folder inside this repository represents a **separate mini-project or practice module**, such as:

* Student Management
* Employee CRUD
* User Authentication
* Product Management
* API Testing Modules

Each module follows standard Spring Boot architecture with:

* Controller
* Service
* Repository
* Model / Entity

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

* Practice backend development consistently
* Improve API design and database handling
* Gain confidence in Spring Boot and enterprise Java
* Build a strong GitHub profile for job applications

## How to Run Any Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code)
3. Configure MySQL database in `application.properties`
4. Run the Spring Boot main class
5. Test APIs using Postman or browser

## Future Enhancements
